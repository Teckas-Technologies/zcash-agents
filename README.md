   - Bridge **ZEC tokens** from the **Zcash Network** to the **NEAR Protocol**.  
   - Fetch your current ZEC balance.  
   - Withdraw bridged ZEC tokens from **NEAR intents** back to the **Zcash Network**.

2. **Swap Assistant**  
   - Swap your **ZEC tokens** to other supported tokens within the **NEAR Protocol** using conversational commands.

3. **Trade Assistant**  
   - Automatically invest ZEC tokens in **top-performing tokens** based on **momentum strategy**.  
   - The strategy auto-exits trades after **24 hours**, books profits, and transfers funds back to your intents wallet.  
   - Users can manually **book profits** or **withdraw** at any time using the assistant.
